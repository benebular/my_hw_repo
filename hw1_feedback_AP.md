Great job overall!
Some notes: <br>
In addition to what you described, the exploratory analysis also is the time where you'd ideally determine missing variables as well as any skewness in the data and figure out how to handle them. <br>
Questions 2b and 3b: Another, more visual, way of figuring out skewness or outliers is to just plot a histogram or boxplot.
