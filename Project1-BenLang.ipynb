    "Answer: First, load the data and run some summary/descriptive statistics on the data to get a feel for what the data looks like in numbers. Then, produce graphs of the data. Multiple graph types will be necessary because certain graphs are not good with certain types of variables e.g. categorical variables do great on histograms, but continuous variables might not give you an idea of what the data is showing. Then, chose two variables to compare e.g. admittance rate (admit) and GRE scores (gre). Run a linear regression model on these data in order to see how much they vary from each other. Last, interpret to results to determine if GRE score is a good predictor of admittance rate."
